    <h5 id = 'dmD'>Digital minimalism is a philosophy that helps you question what digital communication tools (and behaviors surrounding these tools) add the most value to your life. It is motivated by the belief that intentionally and aggressively clearing away low-value digital noise, and optimizing your use of the tools that really matter, can significantly improve your life. - Cal Newport</h5>

    <h4>1. 30 Day Reset</h4>
    <p>Cal Newport, King of Digital Minimalism, drafted out a thirty day technology reset. Essentially, individuals are encouraged to try to go thirty days without using any non-essential technology. If you're interested, you can read more in his book "Digital Minimalism."</p>

    <h4>2. Practice mindfulness </h4>
    <p>When you engage in activities, try focusing on the singular activity you're doing. When you're washing dishes, try turning off your music and really focusing on all the sensations associated with the activity at hand. Don't let your mind wander too far into the future nor the past. You may find that your everyday life is far more interesting and engaging when you're really working on experiencing it. </p>

    <h4>3. Nurture offline hobbies</h4>
    <p>Reconnect with hobbies that fill you with joy outside of your computer! Consider activities like running, gardening, baking, surfing, skating, woodworking, bullet journaling, knitting, painting, fishing, hiking, swimming, etc.. The opportunities to enrich your real life are endless. Pretty soon, you'll see you get so lost in creating and doing that you'll not even be thinking about passive consumption of low-quality information online. </p>

    <h4>4. Spend time alone </h4>
    <p>Allow yourself time to exist in true solitude. Remove yourself from all forms of socialization and consumption: leave your phone behind, turn off your music, put your book down, step away from friends. Try keeping yourself company with your own thoughts and ideas. You'll be surprised with how creative and interesting you really are. </p>

    <h4>5. Investigate tools to help limit screentime</h4>
    <p>There are so many tools that exist to help you guard your precious time against addictive algorithms. Tools like the program Freedom and Apple's screen-time limiter all can help interrupt you in mindless scrolling. </p>
